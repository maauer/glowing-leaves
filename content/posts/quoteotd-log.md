Also, here is a random quote I found written on a log in the woods:
Time goes by, people change, paint fades, buildings get torn down. But through, through the shivering and changing and the __________ look of consistancy in you life, your memories will live on untainted. For they are pure and perfect. Rain will not erode them, bulldozers cannot level them and the actions of others will never corrupt them.</p>
